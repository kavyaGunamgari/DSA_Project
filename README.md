Sorting Algorithms:



Merge Sort

Description: Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the data into smaller sub-arrays, sorts them, and then merges them back together. It's known for its efficiency and stability, making it suitable for large datasets.
Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
Quick Sort

Description: Quick Sort is another divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays, with elements less than the pivot on one side and elements greater than the pivot on the other. It's highly efficient for large datasets but can have poor performance on already sorted or nearly sorted data.
Time Complexity: Average case O(n log n), Worst case O(n²)
Space Complexity: O(log n) on average with in-place sorting
Bubble Sort

Description: Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based algorithm where each pair of adjacent elements is compared, and they are swapped if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the array is sorted. It's easy to understand and implement but inefficient for large datasets.
Time Complexity: O(n²)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Search Algorithms
Linear Search

Description: Linear Search is a straightforward method for finding an element in a list. It checks each element sequentially until the desired element is found or the list ends. It is simple but inefficient for large lists.
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Binary Search

Description: Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted list. It repeatedly divides the list in half, comparing the target value to the middle element, until the target is found or the list cannot be divided further.
Time Complexity: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Finding Minimum and Maximum
Finding Minimum and Maximum in an Array
Description: To find the minimum and maximum values in an array, you can use a linear scan to compare each element with the current minimum and maximum values. This ensures that each element is checked only once.
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
By comparing these algorithms, users can understand the difference between time complexity, space complexity, and practical implementation considerations for different types of data and application requirements.
